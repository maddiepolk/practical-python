# Exercise 1.11 (Bonus) - While youâ€™re at it, fix the program to correct for the overpayment that occurs in the last month.

# Exercise 1.12 
# Can you explain this behavior?
# >>> bool("False")
# True

# Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
# Any string is True, except empty strings.
# Any number is True, except 0.
# Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.
